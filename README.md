This repository holds the data and code for the manuscript titled: "Rising Heat, Rising Risks: Understanding the Nexus of Marine Heatwaves, Fishing Dependence, and Vulnerability to Coastal Communities". There is code to download the NOAA 1/4Â° Daily Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (DOISST) dataset, to calculate heatwave metrics with heatwaveR, to run a Principal Components analysis, and to calculate risk metrics. 

Please contact Sally Dowd (sallycdowd@gmail.com) with any questions.
